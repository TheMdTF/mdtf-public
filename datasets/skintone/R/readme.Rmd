# Colorimetric Skin Tone Scale (CST)

This repository contains a sample of the colorimetric data and methods used to 
create the colorimetric skin tone scale (CST).  Users of this repository must abide by the terms of the included license agreement (https://github.com/TheMdTF/mdtf-public/blob/master/LICENSE.md).  Research or other derivative work must cite:

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following directories and key files:

### `data/`
This folder contains raw input data used in the README example:

- `colorimetric_scale.csv` – The values computed for the CST scale based on the data sample
- `idsl_skin_tone_sample.csv` – A sample of colorimetric skin tone readings

### `images/`
This folder contains image files needed for README.md

### `R/`
This folder holds all R scripts and Markdown files:

- `readme.Rmd` – R Markdown file that generates the README content
- `make_readme.R` – Script to render `readme.Rmd` into `README.md`
- `colorimetric_skin_tone_scale.R` – Helper functions to create and render the CST scale

### `README.md`
This file — generated by rendering `readme.Rmd` — describes the project and contains plots and tables.

## Scale Values

The colorimetric skin tone scale is comprised of ten skin tone swatches selected
to span the human skin lightness range from 20 to 70 L* units in CIELAB color 
space.  The values of a* and b* are computed automatically based on an observed
skin tone gamut.

## Skin Tone Gamut

The CST was developed to span an observed skin tone gamut.  The image below plots the skin tone gamut included in this repository and marks the location of the CST scale.
